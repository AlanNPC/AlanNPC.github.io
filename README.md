## About me


I am currently a first-year PhD student at UCLA CS Department. I am a member of the [Wireless and Networking Group (WiNG)](http://metro.cs.ucla.edu), advised by [Prof. Songwu Lu](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~slu/). My research interests lie in future mobile networks, IoT, mobile security and more. Prior to UCLA, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University, under the supervision of [Prof. Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/).
